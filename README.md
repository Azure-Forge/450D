Generate array from generate_450d.py first

Once array is created we can now change variable in index.py to any message that will be encrypted as chipertext as rgb_vals in 450d array, and its recovered message

How It Works

When initializing the data, we generate RGB values to create a structured array that represents color information.

    Data Structure:
    We use an array (typically 3D) where each element corresponds to a pixel’s color, storing three values: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).

    RGB Value Generation:
    For each pixel, the system generates or assigns RGB values—integers ranging from 0 to 255—that define the pixel’s color.

    Populating the Array:
    These RGB values are stored in the array at the pixel’s position, building a full representation of the image or data.

    Result:
    The completed array serves as a digital image or dataset, encoding color information that can be processed, displayed, or transformed.

This approach allows us to efficiently represent and manipulate color data for visualization or further analysis.
